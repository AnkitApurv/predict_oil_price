## Background On Oil Trading

### Parties and Trade Agreements

Oil aka the major fuel source of the present day industrial world is overwhelmingly bought and sold in USD (a completely fiat currency,backed by nothing, acting as reserve currency of the world).

Furthermore, this commodity is largely bought and sold via long-term contracts between:

- Large multinational companies with requisite logistics and financial backing
- Partner countries
- Multi-country institutions like OPEC which are effectively a cartel of Oil producing countries.

### Value Addition

Oil is largely bought/sold and then transported in two ways concerning the processing of oil into usable state:

- Crude Oil and Natural Gas
    - Little to no value addition
    - Costs involved:
        - Extraction from wells, fracking etc
        - Transportation
- Processed, refined oil products such as Petrol, Diesel and other oil products
    - Significant Oil refineries' value addition
    - Costs involved:
        - Extraction from wells, fracking etc
        - Transportation

### Costs and Logistics

- Extraction from wells, fracking etc
- Transportation via:
    - Tanker ships
        - Continuous significant costs, especially in case of:
        - international financial turmoil (banking and insurance sector impact)
        - piracy, war at the high seas
    - Pipelines
        - One time significant cost amortized over many years of trade
- Oil refineries' value addition

## Conclusion on Oil trading Prices

Taking into account the [background](#background-on-oil-trading), it can be assumed that, oil prices are largely impacted by following set of factors in order from higher to lower impact (guessed):

- International finance and geo-political situation
- Added costs:
    - Value addition via refining
    - Logistical complexity and costs
    - Transportation distances between buyer and seller
- Negotiating ability of the buyer and seller vis-a-vis their counter-parties
